          >
          is a directive that aims to improve the functioning of the internal
          market for accessible products and services, by removing barriers
          created by divergent rules in Member States.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was adopted by the European Parliament on 13 December 2016 and is
          expected to come into force on 28 June 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          The European Accessibility Act will be the first EU law to
          specifically address the rights of people with disabilities. It will
          ensure that people with disabilities are able to live independently
          and participate in the life of their communities. It will also ensure
          that people with disabilities have the same rights as everyone else.
        </p>
        <p>Businesses will benefit from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            common rules on accessibility in the EU leading to costs reduction
          </li>
          <li>easier cross-border trading</li>
          <li>
            more market opportunities for their accessible products and services
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Persons with disabilities and elderly people will benefit from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>more accessible products and services in the market</li>
          <li>accessible products and services at more competitive prices</li>
          <li>
            fewer barriers when accessing transport, education and the open
            labour market
          </li>
          <li>more jobs available where accessibility expertise is needed</li>
